# Lab 4: Game Of Life

We chose to implement the Game of life in our mini-project, since it is a classical programming problem giving an insight to the paradigms. Our purpose is to incorporate monads, preferably our own implementation of monads, with a basic visualisation of the world.

Development phases:

1. basic Game of life on a plain with only text output for testing,  
2. parsing of input file,
3. testing with common patterns from the wikipedia page. (still lives, oscillators, space ships)
4. graphical visualisation of the progress of the game,
5. extension for a toroidal world.
