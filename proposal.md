# Lab 4: Game Of Life

## Team 18

## Problem

We choose to implement the Game of Life in our mini-project, since it is a classical programming problem giving an insight to the paradigm used to implement it. Our purpose is to incorporate monads, preferably our own implementation of monads, with a basic visualisation of the world.

## Development phases

1. basic Game of Life on a plain with only text output for testing,
2. parsing of (standard formatted) input files,
3. testing with common patterns (e.g.: still lives, oscillators, space ships)
4. graphical visualisation of the progress of the game (employing the gnuplot interface module),
5. extension for a toroidal world,
6. colour-coding cells by age (optional, time-dependent).
